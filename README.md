# 0.1 - 29/01/23

This first commit stands for the creation of the repo. The character controller, environment, state machine and loader are implemented, but are still buggy. Mostly, the collider doesn't work well, and needs to be tweaked. Socket is missing, login UI has to be done and connected to Covo Link, and the hotel and player models are still missing. 

Most of the code was learned through the Guided Learning tutorial [Create A Game Tutorial Series](https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/createAGame) on the Babylon.js docs.
