# 0.1 - 29/01/23

This first commit stands for the creation of the repo. The character controller, environment, state machine and loader are implemented, but are still buggy. Mostly, the collider doesn't work well, and needs to be tweaked. Socket is missing, login UI has to be done and connected to Covo Link, and the hotel and player models are still missing. 

Most of the code was learned through the Guided Learning tutorial [Create A Game Tutorial Series](https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/createAGame) on the Babylon.js docs.

# 0.2 - 30/01/23

This second main commit enable online features such Express & Socket communication. Multiplayer functionalities has to be added in the next commits, giving more complex functions to Covo Hotel 2 Socket.io framework (spawn other players, share position and trasmit actions).

The code was made with an all nighter of offenses to God caused by Webpack of my ass, no tutorial on the internet could help me with that hell.

# 0.3 - 07/02/23

Socket is implemented correctly and 100% working. Starting to work to the real multiplayer experience, managing other players position and actions in real-time.

NPCs present a bug where only one NPC can be put on the scene.
